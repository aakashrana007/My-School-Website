#Middle School Website Development Project| HTML,CSS,JS

I created a website for my middle school entirely using HTML, CSS, and basic 
JavaScript to manage email submissions. While not a professional undertaking, 
this project significantly boosted my proficiency in web development. It included 
designing the site's layout, enhancing its visual appeal through styling, and 
integrating essential features for handling email interactions. This hands-on 
experience provided me with practical insights into front-end development and 
strengthened my capability to build user-friendly web applications.
